# Module 8 Challenge: Vehicle Builder

![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description 

This command-line application allows users to create and manage vehicles, performing various actions on each. Built using Node.js with TypeScript for strict typing and Inquirer for user prompts, the project enables users to create new vehicles or select existing ones to interact with. Supported vehicles include cars, trucks, and motorbikes, each with specific attributes like VIN number, weight, and tires.

Once a vehicle is created, users can perform actions such as starting the vehicle, accelerating, decelerating, turning, and printing details. Trucks have additional towing functionality, while motorbikes can perform wheelies. After performing an action, users can continue to interact with the vehicle, return to the main menu, or exit the application.
